# Apple Quality Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying the quality of apples using machine learning techniques. It was completed in 2024 as part of the Machine Learning course at the Group T campus of KU Leuven (KUL), within the ICT program.

```python
#LogisticsRegression_Apple.ipynb:
#This file is an attempt at linear regression in this project. 
#The linear regression classifier built using the code learned in class has a low final accuracy rate (74.32%).
```


```python
#main_v1.ipynb:
#Including data loading, data processing, data analysis and various model training, 
#we achieved relatively good results during the milestone period.
```


```python
#main_v2.ipynb
#In addition to all the processes of main_v1, there are various visualization processes to generate images required for posters and reports, 
#integrating and condensing all traditional machine learning methods together, 
#and generating the final result display diagram together with the results of AQNet.
```


```python
#model_config_structureTest.ipynb
#AQNet model code with adjustable parameters is used to try out various possibilities of model structure and select the most suitable one.
```


```python
#AUC.ipynb
#AUC graph used to generate the final results of AQNet
```
