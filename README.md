# üçé Apple Quality Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying the quality of apples using machine learning techniques.  
It was completed in 2024 as part of the **Machine Learning** course at the **Group T campus of KU Leuven (KUL)**, under the **ICT program**.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project consists of several Jupyter Notebooks, each serving a specific purpose in the development and evaluation of machine learning models:

### 1. `main_v1.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Initial version of the project pipeline.
- **Includes**: Data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.
- **Outcome**: Achieved decent performance during the milestone stage.

### 2. `main_v2.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Enhanced version for final presentation.
- **Includes**:
  - All functionalities from `main_v1`.
  - Additional visualization for posters and final report.
  - Integration of all traditional machine learning models.
  - Final result comparison with the AQNet deep learning model.

### 3. `LogisticsRegression_Apple.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: A trial using logistic regression (not linear regression, despite the name).
- **Remarks**: The accuracy was relatively low (~74.32%), showing limitations of linear models in this context.

### 4. `model_config_structureTest.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Testing different versions of the custom-built deep learning model **AQNet**.
- **Focus**: Structural experimentation by adjusting hyperparameters and layer designs to find the optimal architecture.

### 5. `AUC.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Generating AUC (Area Under the Curve) graphs.
- **Usage**: These plots were used in the final evaluation and reporting of the AQNet performance.
